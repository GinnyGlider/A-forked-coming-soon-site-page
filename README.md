## About The Fork

<p>I'm temporarily borrowing Catherine's front-end homework, for my site. 
Just until I can figure out web development myself :) 
I chose hers because I like the aesthetic of the "coming soon" site page.
Edit: Right, I realise  it isn't her's but from a challenge... Which I will totally do as well.
